# EXP 2 : ANALYSIS THE DISK STRUCTURE USING SLEUTH KIT

## AIM:
To analyze the internal disk structure of a disk image using Sleuth Kit tools and identify file system metadata, directory structure, and other forensic details for digital investigation purposes.

## EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:
●	Hardware: Personal Computer (PC)

```
Register Number: 212222040121
Name: Praveen V
```

## DESIGN STEPS:
### Step 1:
Obtain or create a disk image file (e.g., praveendisk.iso) to analyze. 

### Step 2:
Use Sleuth Kit tools like istat, fsstat, and fls to examine the partition layout, file system details, and file listing.

### Step 3:
Interpret the output of the tools to understand the disk structure, including partitions, sectors, and files.

## PRELIMINARY STEP:
### Step1:
  ●	Run command prompt as administrator

### Step2:
  ●	Verify Sleuthkit is installed.

Step3:
  ●	Navigate to the binary file of Sleuthkit in command prompt: 
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e792732-51f0-4b7f-b299-cc21699104e8)

## PROCEDURE:
## ANALYSE THE FILE USING SLEUTHKIT TOOL:

### 1. View File Metadata
  ●	Use istat to view metadata of a file/directory using its inode number 0:
  ●	Command:  istat.exe -f filetype “file path” <inode number>
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39128d45-4178-478e-857b-d6ad4a927c59)

    
   OUTPUT SUMMARY:
        ●	Type: Directory
        ●	Permissions: dr-xr-xr-x (read + execute for all)
        ●	Created On: 2025-04-14 12:43:12 IST
        ●	Size: 2048 bytes, Sectors Used: 31
2. View Metadata of Inode 1
●	Use istat to view metadata of a file/directory using its inode number 1:
●	Command:  istat.exe -f filetype “file path” <inode number>
    
   OUTPUT SUMMARY:
●	Type: Directory (metasploitable-linux-2.0.0)
●	Permissions: dr-xr-xr-x (read + execute for all)
●	Created On: 2 2025-03-11 19:34:00 IST
●	Size: 2048 bytes, Sectors Used: 32
3. View Metadata of Inode 6
●	Use istat to view metadata of a file/directory using its inode number 6:
●	Command:  istat.exe -f filetype “file path” <inode number>
 

   OUTPUT SUMMARY:
●	File Name: Metasploitable.vmx — This is a VMware configuration.
●	Type: File — It's a regular file, not a folder.
●	Permissions: -r-xr-xr-x — Read & execute allowed for everyone, no write access.
●	Created Time: 2025-03-11 19:34:16 IST — This is when the file was added to the ISO.
●	Size: 2804 bytes — Small file (just a few KB).
●	Sectors: 940391, 940392 — The disk sectors storing this file's content.

4. Analysis of Inode 6 Metadata via icat Utility

●	Use icat to extract file content using its inode number 6:

●	Command:  icat.exe -f filetype “file path” <inode number>
   




    
OUTPUT SUMMARY:
The command retrieves the contents of a VMware virtual machine configuration                      file (Metasploitable.vmx). This file defines how the virtual machine is set up,   including:
●	Hardware settings like CPU (numvcpus = "1"), RAM (memsize = "512"), and SCSI controller.
●	Networking options, with both NAT (ethernet0) and Host-only (ethernet1) adapters configured.
●	Storage devices, such as virtual hard disk (Metasploitable.vmdk) and CD-ROM (auto detect).
●	Additional devices like USB, EHCI, and multiple PCI bridges.
●	VM metadata, including UUID, display name (Metasploitable2-Linux), OS type (ubuntu), and annotations.
●	Security note: The annotation warns that this VM is intentionally vulnerable and should not be exposed to untrusted networks.





5. View File System Details Using fsstat
●	Use fsstat to view file system metadata of the ISO image.

●	Command:  fsstat -f filetype “file path”
 
 
OUTPUT SUMMARY:
 PRIMARY VOLUME DESCRIPTOR 1
 File System Information:
•	File System Type: ISO9660
•	Volume Name: 14_04_2025
•	Volume Set Size: 1
•	Volume Set Sequence: 1
•	Recording Application: AnyBurn
   Metadata Information:
•	Path Table Location: 22–22
•	Inode Range: 0 – 9
•	Root Directory Block: 36827386058113052
    Content Information:
•	Sector Size: 2048 bytes
•	Block Size: 2048 bytes
•	Total Sector Range: 0 – 940393
•	Total Block Range: 0 – 940393

6.List Directory Structure

●	Use fls to view directory structure.

●	Command:  fls -f filetype -r  “file path”
 
OUTPUT SUMMARY:
•	Root Directory: metasploitable-linux-2.0.0 (Inode 1)
•	Contained Files and Subdirectories:
o	Metasploitable2-Linux/ — A directory (Inode 2)
o	Metasploitable.nvram — NVRAM file storing BIOS settings (Inode 3)
o	Metasploitable.vmdk — Virtual hard disk file (Inode 4)
o	Metasploitable.vmsd — Snapshot metadata file (Inode 5)
o	Metasploitable.vmx — Main configuration file (Inode 6)
o	Metasploitable.vmxf — Extended configuration file (Inode 7)

•	Special Entries:
o	$OrphanFiles — Virtual directory for orphaned files (Inode 9)
o	OrphanFile-8 — An orphan file detected (Inode 8)

6. Image File Information

●	Use img_stat – Sleuth Kit utility for viewing image file metadata.

●	Command:  img_stat  “file path”
     
 
OUTPUT SUMMARY:
•	Image Type: raw
•	Size in Bytes: 1925926912 (approx. 1.79 GB)
•	Sector Size: 512 bytes
•	Confirms that the input image is a raw format disk image with standard sector configuration.
